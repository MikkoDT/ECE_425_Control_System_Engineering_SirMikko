## COURSE INFORMATION SYLLABUS (CIS): []()

### Course Rationale and Description
Understanding control systems empowers students to model and characterize physical systems mathematically enabling him to create systems that will benefit humanity. Control systems engineering is an exciting field where you can apply your engineering talents and technical knowledge because it cuts across numerous disciplines and various functions with those disciplines. The control engineer can be found at the top level of large projects. Engaged at the actual conceptual phase in determining and implementing overall system requirements, which includes total system performance specifications, subsystem functions, and the interconnection of these functions including interface requirements, hardware and software design, test plans and procedures. A working knowledge in control systems prepares students to understand its application in robotics, process control industry and manufacturing. The course will deal mainly on the system modelling in time and frequency domain, transfer function, block diagram algebra, and signal flow graphs. This course is intended for fourth year students of Mechanical Engineering who has completed the courses Differential Equations and Basic Electronics.

COURSE POLICIES																			
A.	GRADING SYSTEM																		
	The grading system adopted by this course is as follows:																		
	Excellent			1.00	98	-	100												
	Superior			1.25	94	-	97												
	Very Good			1.5	90	-	93												
	Good			1.75	88	-	89												
	Meritorious			2.00	85	-	87												
	Very Satisfactory			2.25	83	-	84												
	Satisfactory			2.50	80	-	82												
	Fairly Satisfactory			2.75	78	-	79												
	Passing			3.00	75	-	77												
	Failure			5.00	Below 70														
	Incomplete			INC															
	*Students who got a computed grade of 70-74 will be given an appropriate remedial activity in which the final grade should be either passing (3.0) or failure (5.0).																		
B. 	CLASS POLICY																		
	Prompt and regular attendance of students is required. Total unexcused absences shall not exceed ten (10) percent of the maximum number of hours required per course per semester (or per summer term). A semester has 18 weeks.																		
	MISSED EXAMINATIONS																		
	Students who failed to take the exam during the schedule date can be given a special exam provided he/she has valid reason. If it is health reason, he/she should provide the faculty with the medical certificate signed by the attending Physician. Other reasons shall be assessed first by the faculty to determine its validity.																		
	ACADEMIC DISHONESTY																		
	Academic dishonesty includes acts such as cheating during examinations or plagiarism in connection with any academic work. Such acts are considered major offenses and will be dealt with according to the University’s Student Norms of Conduct.																		
	DROPPING																		
	"Dropping must be made official by accomplishing a dropping form and submitting it at the Registrar’s Office before the midterm examination. Students who officially drop out of class shall be marked “Dropped” whether he took the preliminary examination or not and irrespective of their preliminary grades.
A student who unofficially drops out of class shall be given a mark of “5.0” by the instructor."																		
C. 	OTHER COURSE POLICIES AND REQUIREMENTS																		
	Every student is expected to participate in every class activity. Students may do the ungraded activities on their own time. However, students are encourage to at least do this synchronously with the class. They are also encouraged to work on the activities with groups of their classmates. The purpose of the activities is to practice with the material and to improve stduents' understanding. It is encouraged that students engage learning from each other, and may ask the instructor when there are questions. However, the solutions submitted for grading must be done individually. This ensures that that sudents understand the reasoning of each problem, even if they initially solved the problem with the help of their classmates.																		
	There will be two major examinations and two quizzes to be done in person. Other requirements may be submitted online via google forms or other e-learning platforms. Problem sets, assignments and other exercises will be given to fully understand the concepts being presented in class. It will be due at the beginning of the following lecture period unless otherwise specified. Late requirement/s will not be accepted and will be given a score of zero.
