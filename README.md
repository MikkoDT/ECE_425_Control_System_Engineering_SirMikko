# ECE 425: Control Systems Engineering

### Course Instructor: Engr. Mikko A. De Torres
###                    Mechatronics Engineer

## COURSE INFORMATION SYLLABUS (CIS)

### Course Rationale and Description
Understanding control systems empowers students to model and characterize physical systems mathematically enabling him to create systems that will benefit humanity. Control systems engineering is an exciting field where you can apply your engineering talents and technical knowledge because it cuts across numerous disciplines and various functions with those disciplines. The control engineer can be found at the top level of large projects. Engaged at the actual conceptual phase in determining and implementing overall system requirements, which includes total system performance specifications, subsystem functions, and the interconnection of these functions including interface requirements, hardware and software design, test plans and procedures. A working knowledge in control systems prepares students to understand its application in robotics, process control industry and manufacturing. The course will deal mainly on the system modelling in time and frequency domain, transfer function, block diagram algebra, and signal flow graphs. This course is intended for fourth year students of Mechanical Engineering who has completed the courses Differential Equations and Basic Electronics.
